# Extra Resources and Readings

The first place to start is Google; a huge part of being a good
developer is learning how to find answers to things you don't
know. Many of the best results come from
[Stack Overflow][stack-overflow]. If you don't find what you need,
start a thread there yourself!

A key part of learning programming is learning how to get
unstuck. It's going to be hard going at first, but you're going to get
much better at it with practice!

## Common Methods and Classes

### Peter Cooper's summary of useful methods and classes

* Beginning Ruby, Appendix B.

### Ruby Docs

The built-in, basic datatypes (Array, String, Hash) contain many
useful methods that make your life easier. There's a lot of power in
them. The Ruby documentation lists out all these methods:

*  [Array](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html)
*  [String](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html)
*  [Hash](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Hash.html)
*  [Enumerable](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html)
 * Array, and Hash both _mixin_ Enumerable, which means you can use
   Enumerable methods when working with either an Array or
   Hash. Enumerable contains many useful methods.

With just these few pages, you will be able to write a lot of powerful
logic/code. Try to be as familiar as you can with these.

## Optional Supplemental Readings

Below are additional materials that will help you get a leg up on Ruby.

### Introductory

* [Command Line Crash Course](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
  Please go through this book if you don't have much experience with the
  command line. 1, 2, 4-7, 10-16 are the essential chapters. 17-19 are
  optional.

### Intermediate

* Peter Cooper's Beginning Ruby
    * ch12: build a larger project in Ruby
* [Ruby Koans](http://www.rubykoans.com/). A good introduction to
  [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) & Ruby.
