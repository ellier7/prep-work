# Coding Exercise II

After you complete the first coding exercise successfully, you'll be
invited to take the second coding exercise. This one will test your
ability to apply basic programming principles to solve somewhat more
complicated problems.

**Note**: These practice problems will not be found on codeacademy. Instead you
will be running them through a web based development environment. Please see the
[setup ruby instructions][setup] on how to get started.
