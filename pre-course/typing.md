# Typing Practice (required)

As a programmer it is crucial to be able to touch-type effectively. We
expect incoming students to be capable of typing at least 60WPM. Stopping
to look at the keyboard will reduce your productivity and distract you from
the course material, so take the time you have now and become an
excellent typist. Additionally, writing Ruby will require you to touch-type
non-alphanumeric keys like `}`, `|`, `#`, `<`, and `@`, so make sure
your fingers know where they are too.

### Assignment
Take a moment to test your raw typing speed on
[typeracer][type-racer]. If you're able to consistently score above
60WPM, try typing through the first 100 lines of _Ruby on Rails_ at
[typing.io][typing-io]. If you have trouble typing above 60WPM at
typeracer, or can't type through _RoR_ without looking at the
keyboard, you need to practice regularly before the course begins.
If you're already fast, work on increasing your accuracy and reducing
wasted keystrokes with [typing.io][typing-io] and `gtypist`.

### Typing Resources
* [Type Fu][type-fu] - Good for drilling the
  fundamentals of touch-typing.
* [TypeRacer][type-racer] - An excellent way to increase your raw
  WPM once you have the fundamentals down.
* [Typing.io][typing-io] - Once you know how to touch-type and can do
  so quickly and accurately, practice typing in Ruby here. Time permitting, 
  everyone should go through the _Ruby on Rails_ section.
* [GNU Typist][gtypist] (_AKA_ `gtypist`) - My favorite. An open source
  command-line typing tutor. Excellent for beginners just learning to
  type, as well as experienced touch-typists wanting to increase accuracy
  and speed. Can be installed with most package managers like MacPorts
  (`sudo port install gtypist`) or Homebrew (`brew install
  gtypist`). Tip: If it really bothers you, you can google around for
  adjusted lessons that get rid of the two-spaces-after-periods
  nonsense on certain lessons.
