# Coding Exercise I

Hi there! The next step in your application process is the online
coding exercise. Before you start it, look over the prepwork we've
prepared for you. Especially if you're new to coding, this prepwork is
meant to introduce you to the programming concepts you'll need to
succeed on the exercise.

## tl;dr

Read all of this document. But here's the executive summary:

0. Read the **[Introduction to Programming][intro-to-programming-1]**.
0. Do the **[practice problems][practice-problems]**. Review the
   solutions.
0. When you're well prepared (and not before), start the exercise! We
   don't give any preference to applicants based on how soon they
   start the exercise, so take your time to prepare properly!

## What is the coding exercise?

We will ask you to solve a short coding exercise composed of
**four or five coding problems that measure basic programming
knowledge**. The exercise is timed: **you will have up to 45 minutes
to complete the exercise**.

## How difficult is the exercise?

**The coding exercise is meant to be accessible to everyone**. Many
of our applicants have never programmed before. Everyone should review
these prepwork materials, which are intended to teach you the
fundamental concepts of programming so that you can succeed on the
exercise.

## How do I setup Ruby?

Please see the [setup instructions][setup] document.

[setup]: ./setup.md

## How do I prepare for the exercise?

**You will want to prepare for the coding exercise so that you do
your best**.

**First, you should review our Introduction to Programming**. This
will cover the fundamental concepts of programming you'll need to
know. **We recommend that you at least skim them even if you already
know how to program**:

* **[Introduction To Programming I][intro-to-programming-1]**
* **[Introduction To Programming II][intro-to-programming-2]**
* **[Introduction To Programming III][intro-to-programming-3]**
* **[Introduction To Programming Summary][intro-to-programming-summary]**

[intro-to-programming-1]: ./introduction-to-programming-1.md
[intro-to-programming-2]: ./introduction-to-programming-2.md
[intro-to-programming-3]: ./introduction-to-programming-3.md
[intro-to-programming-summary]: ./introduction-to-programming-summary.md

**Second, we provide practice problems**. Do these after you have read
the three parts of Introduction to Programming:

* **[Practice Problems][practice-problems]**

[practice-problems]: ./practice-problems

Doing the practice problems will build your familiarity with Ruby, and
give you a good idea what the level of difficulty is on the coding
exercise. It is not required, but **we strongly suggest that you
complete all the practice problems before taking the coding
exercise**. We want you to be well prepared.

## What programming language do I write in?

We have designed the exercise to be done in Ruby, which is the
language of Rails. The readings and practice problems we've provided
are in Ruby.

You may also answer the exercise in Python or JavaScript. We will in
no way penalize you for using Python or JavaScript. **You should use
whatever language you are most comfortable with; we want you to do
your best**.

Some languages are not well suited for the coding exercise. If you
know another language and would strongly prefer to answer in that,
please contact us: [admissions@appacademy.io][admissions].

## How soon should I take the exercise?

**Take all the time you need to prepare for the exercise**. We want
you to do your best. We do not give any preference to applicants based
on how soon they take the exercise. **Prematurely beginning the
exercise before completing the prepwork will hurt your
application**. Taking your time to prepare thoroughly will help you.

The exercise will take up to 45 minutes. **Please have time set aside
so that you can complete the exercise unhurried by other
commitments.**

## Can I use Google for answers during the exercise?

**Please** do not search Google for answers to the problems; it is
very easy for us to tell when solutions have been taken from Google.
**Please do not post the problems to the internet**.
